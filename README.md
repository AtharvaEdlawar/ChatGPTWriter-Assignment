Update I have not been Selected for the role completed and interegrated a Ai response For the Given Assignment .Code was just sitting on the pc Hope it helps someone. 
P.S Groq has a daily Limit on tokens per minute and per day.


Idea For the project 
1)add a dropDown in the model To changed the LMs then feed it to the Groq request model. 
2)context can also be to the model then can be fed to  the groq request model  NOTE context should be fed before the prompt Example: 'respond to' + context + prompt

ui have been changed (Just the color theme)
Also added a Login Signup popUp
The main Script in the content.tsx 
POPUp contatins the login.
